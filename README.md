# Simplify t2.social

Hi, I'm [Michael Leggett](https://leggett.org) and I like to simplify and enhance popular web apps. This is a minimal browser extension to simplify [t2.social](https://t2.social), similar to what I've built for [Twitter](https://twitter.simpl.fyi), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.simpl.fyi), and [Gmail](https://simpl.fyi/install). 

I don't expect anyone to contribute to this nor do I expect to spend a lot of time on the extension myself (I've mostly built what I wanted to). But I'll consider any requests or submissions and I'll keep it working so long as I'm using T2.
